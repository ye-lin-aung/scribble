# Fk !. 
There have been a lot of negative thinking swirling around in my mind. Everything I touch, everything I see, every person I interact some hows do shit on me. I plays games every night with my high school friends. This is the time I normally relax myself after working for long hard work. So there is some guy who is really really bad at game, when I said bad, he is super bad. Getting 1 or 2 kills in whole valorant match. But he never listen to friends's suggestions or train for the sake of the team. He will just try to gank the enemy team while he can't frag. So we always ended up playing with 4/5 people. Today I told him not to gank and he said he will still gank cuz he like. This is 5th times I get same answer from him this week. So its my time to throw. I throw hard. Also I don't throw a whole game with the sake of others, I only played marshall. And I still get MVP of the match. I am good right?

So tired of people these days. There are certain times in my life that I got sick of people and I stopped talking to others. I still need to improve alot on that. phwew. Living itself is a hell. People who dies are people who got rewarded with peaceful life by god. 

Looking forward to my reward of peace by god.
