The reason I started writing blogs is to concentrate my mind. During  the coup and all these dark times, I was depressed, sad and worried every minute. I started writing small things, research tools and I feel like I am a bit more concentrated and before. The meaning of scribbles is 
```
Write or draw (something) carelessly or hurriedly.
```
Its same as the meaning. Normally I have a lot of random thoughts and ideas brewing inside my brain and I never wrote them down. I read a lot of books and do a lot of techincal researches and I never wrote them down. And I will forget after 3 or 4 years and I need to read them again. This scribbles is my notes, my random thoughts and random writing. Please forgive me if you find something offended you. You can freely write email to hello.yelinaung@gmail.com. I still have a lot of technical ideas I want to share. Stay tune!
