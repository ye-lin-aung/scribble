This is the first time I contributed to big projects. And It was released today with the name I give. As a mile stone, I am going to write a blog for that as a memory.

Zawgyi (Burmese: ဇော်ဂျီ) is a semi-immortal human alchemist and mystic with supernatural powers and often seen with a magic stick and a red hat. Zawgyi is one of the supernatural figures in Burmese mythology and folklore. Name chosen by new (Myanma!) contributor @ye-lin-aung.

The headline feature of this release is a new integration with the localhost gem. Localhost takes care of creating a self-signed SSL certificate for you in development. Require it in your config.ru:

# Sinatra
```
require './app'
require 'localhost/authority'
run Sinatra::Application
```

# Rails 
```
require 'localhost/authority' if Rails.env.development?
run MyRailsApp::Application
```

... and in the development environment, Puma will use a self-signed SSL cert generated by Localhost if no other cert is provided.

### Features

Automatic SSL certificate provisioning for localhost, via localhost gem ([#2610], [#2257])
add support for the PROXY protocol (v1 only) ([#2654], [#2651])
Add a semantic CLI option for no config file ([#2689])

### Bugfixes

allow multiple after_worker_fork hooks ([#2690])
Preserve BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG on worker fork ([#2688], [#2687])
